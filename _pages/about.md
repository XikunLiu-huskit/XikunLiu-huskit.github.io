I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Laboratory](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/ipn-lab/us/index.html), Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Dr. Weisong WEN](https://weisongwen.github.io/) and co-supervised by [Dr. Li-Ta Hsu](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/people/academic-staff/dr-hsu-li-ta/). My research interests include perception-aided GNSS positioning and sensor fusion in highly challenging environments.
