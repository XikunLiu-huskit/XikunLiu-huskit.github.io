I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Aeronautical and Aviation Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Dr. Weisong WEN](https://weisongwen.github.io/) at [Intelligent Positioning and Navigation Laboratory](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/aae/ipn-lab/us/index.html). My research interests include perception-aided GNSS positioning and sensor fusion in highly challenging environments.
